# TriviaWordSearch

# Introduction:
  The first project for Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp: build your own game.
  Most of us have played Trivia and most of us have played some type of word search game. Now it's time to mix the two. Trivia   Word Search combines trivia questions and includes a word search for each answer! This particular game focuses on fun facts about world countries.

# Instructions:
  The front page includes two buttons: the "HELP" button and the "START GAME" button. Pressing "HELP" will open an instructions page, where the player can read the game objective and rules. Press "HELP" again to close this screen. "START GAME" will automatically give you a list of countries, a random letter grid, a timer and a question.

  The player must read the question and know the correct answer from the given list. To log an answer, click on the letters, which make up the word. The letters can be anywhere on the grid, but be sure to click them in the correct order. To unchoose a letter, click again. If you cannot find a letter, press the "NEXT" button to reshuffle the grid.

  Once the player has each letter chosen and wants to check their answer, they click the "NEXT" button. If the answer is correct, a new question will appear and 10 seconds will be added to the clock. If the answer is incorrect, the grid will reshuffle and the player can try again.

  The game is played agains a clock, meaning if the player runs our of time, they lose the game. To win the game, the player must find the correct answer to each question, before the time runs out.

  Click "PLAY AGAIN" to restart.
